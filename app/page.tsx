            The design/styling should be mobile-first, and on the desktop
            version the bottom menu should instead be on top; with the labels
            &quot;Home&quot; and &quot;Liked&quot;. Feel free to design the
            desktop version as you see fit. You should: - Use styled-components
            or sass for styling - Do a proper breakdown of components - Share
            the repository of where you pushed the code - Try to improve the UI
            in a way that it looks professionally polished, and exhibits your
            knowledge best You can (optional): - Use TypeScript (included in
            NextJS) for keeping things strict - Use ES6 syntax where applicable.
            Disregard the functionality of links (name, tags, comments) â€” but
            style them accordingly. Do not bother about user logins - this is a
            very sad one-user system. Remember - documentation is your friend.
            This is a test to measure your skills and knowledge.
